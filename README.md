Adventures in Game Engine Design

What?
-----
AGED is my little game engine toolkit project. It's a set of tools/classes for developing games in Java. It's in a very early, but working, state at the moment with a working Entity Manager, a basic component to test with and a little testing class for, um, testing.

This project would never have happened if not for http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/ and the ES example provided there (https://github.com/adamgit/Entity-System-RDBMS-Inspired-Java), which the core of this engine is based on.
