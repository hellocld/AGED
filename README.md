Adventures in Game Engine Design

What?
-----
AGED is my little game engine toolkit project. It's a set of tools/classes for developing games in Java. Currently, there are none; I'm just starting, so go easy on me.
This particular branch should be a better start than play, as I'll actually be creating a proper Entity Manager and Relational Database Management System.
