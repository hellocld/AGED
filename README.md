Adventures in Game Engine Design

What?
-----
AGED is my little game engine toolkit project. It's a set of tools/classes for developing games in Java. It's got a decent working game loop handler, some game state stuff, some basic components and systems, and a couple other things to get you started. It also requires you have LWJGL, so be sure to have that handy (http://www.lwjgl.org).

This project would never have happened if not for http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/ and the ES example provided there (https://github.com/adamgit/Entity-System-RDBMS-Inspired-Java), which the core of this engine is based on.
